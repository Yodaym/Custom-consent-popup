                    <h1>Importance of Latin in modern medicine</h1>
                    <article>
                        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                        <p>Abstract: Long before English became the lingua franca of science, Latin was the dominant language of
                            medicine. In general, Greek and Latin shaped the conventions of scientific,primarily medical, writing for over
                            2000 years. The study presents the advantages of the coexistence of Latin and English in medical terminology
                            and its contribution to ESP teaching. One advantage is the parallel teaching of Latin and ESP courses in the
                            first year of General Medicine programmes at our faculty. Another advantage is the affinity of Latin and
                            English, which results from the historical development of both languages. These advantages will also be
                            reflected in teaching ESP courses, because students can easily combine their knowledgeof both languages,
                            compare differences in word formation and adapt terminology of English-speaking professionals.We consider
                            strategies for teaching and learning of medical terms (vocabulary) to be crucial. To understand the
                            importance of teaching medical vocabulary in ESP courses, both English teachers and students need to
                            understand its historical background. Knowledge of technical terms as well as a layperson (patient)
                            vocabulary is essential for the development of communication skills, i.e. has a significant impact on effective
                            reading and listening comprehension.

                        <h2>BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY</h2>
                        <p>In the textbook „Greco-Latin Medical Terminology‟, Bujalková and Jurečková[7]explain that the
                            history of medical terminology is a part of the history of medicine because medical terms reflect to a
                            certain extent the development of medicine in a given period. The modern language of medicine
                            employs modern derivatives of Greek and Latin words “with no concern for etymological purity” [8].
                            The corpus of Greek and Latin terminology is still the base of contemporary medical language, which
                            also uses new eponyms, acronyms and trade names.
                            The founders of scientific Medicine and terminology were the Ancient Greeks. Since the 6th century
                            BC, they gradually got rid of practices rooted in magic and started to develop medical practice based
                            on experience and Ancient Greek philosophy. They realized the importance of clear and exact terms
                            in the sciences. Ancient Greek Medicine came into existence with Hippocrates, the Father of
                            Medicine. In his time, primitive terms and descriptions were no longer used.</p>

                        <h2>COEXISTENCE OF LATIN AND ENGLISH IN MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY</h2>
                        <p>The extensive borrowing of words from Latin and Greek into English that began about 1500 AD
                            continued for hundreds of years and continues to this day. New advances were made in the field of
                            Medicine and Science during and after the Renaissance (and continuing up to the present day) and
                            words were needed to describe these new discoveries and inventions. Medical scientists turned to the
                            early Greek and Roman physicians, especially Hippocrates, Galen and Celsius, and borrowed words
                            from their medical treatises.</p>
